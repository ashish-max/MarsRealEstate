Introduction
------------

MarsRealEstate is a demo app that shows available properties for sale and for rent on Mars.
The property data is stored on a Web server as a REST web service.  This app demonstrated
the use of [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to make REST requests to the 
web service, [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) to handle the deserialization of the 
returned JSON to Kotlin data objects, and [Glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/) to load and 
cache images by URL.  

The app also leverages [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel),
[LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata), 
[Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) with binding 
adapters, and [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/) 
with the SafeArgs plugin for parameter passing between fragments.
